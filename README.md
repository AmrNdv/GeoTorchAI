# GeoTorch

GeoTorch is a deep learning and scalable data processing framework for raster and spatio-temporal datasets. It's a python library on top of PyTorch and Apache Sedona. It contains various modules for data preprocessing, ready-to-use raster and grid datasets, and neural network models.

## GeoTorch Modules
GeoTorch contains following modules for various types of functionalities:

* Datasets: Conatins processed popular datasets for raster data models and grid based spatio-temporal models. Datasets are available as ready-to-use PyTorch datasets.
* Models: PyTorch wrapper for popular raster data models and grid based spatio-temporal models.|
* Transforms: Various tranformations operations that can be applied to dataset samples during model training.|
* Preprocessing: Supports preprocessing of raster and spatio-temporal datasets in a scalable settings on top of Apache Spark and Apache Sedona. Users don't require the coding concepts of Apache Sedona and Apache Spark.|

## Dependency Set up
Following libraries need to be set up before using GeoTorch.
1. PyTorch 1.10
2. PySpark 3.0.0
3. Apache Sedona 1.2.0-incubating

## Documentation
Details documentation of installation, API, and programming guide is available in geoTorch website.
